# map4
✅ Display restaurants around the user’s current location on a map.
 ✅ Use the FourSquare Search API to query for restaurants: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/search

● Load more restaurants when the user pans the map.
 ○ Cache results in-memory (no need to persist the cache).

- We care about testability and test our own code. Demonstrate that you can write testable code and know how to test effectively.
- Our users expect a stable app. Make sure to check your code for bugs and edge-cases.
- As developers, we spend most of our time reading code. We value code that is easy to read, easy to understand and easy to change.
